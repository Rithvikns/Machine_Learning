# KNN (K - Nearest Neighbours)

It is one of the most simplest and most intuitive algorithm used in machine learning for classification and regression task.
KNN is a non parametric lazy learning algorithm .

### Lazy Learning 

It doesn't compute the discriminating function during the training phase but instead it memorises the training data and computes during the prediction phase
