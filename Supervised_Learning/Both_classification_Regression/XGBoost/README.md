XGBoost - Extreme Gradient Boosting ðŸ“ŠðŸš€
Overview
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and scalable machine learning library for supervised learning tasks such as classification, regression, and ranking. It has become one of the most popular algorithms in data science competitions (like Kaggle) and real-world production environments due to its speed and performance.

Originally developed by Tianqi Chen, XGBoost is designed to optimize computational speed and model performance, making it an excellent choice for large-scale machine learning tasks.

Key Features
Supervised Learning:
Supports both classification and regression problems.

Gradient Boosting Framework:
Builds additive models in a forward stage-wise fashion to minimize the loss function.

Regularization:
Implements L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to prevent overfitting.

Parallel and Distributed Computing:
