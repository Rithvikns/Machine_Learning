# Random Forest Algorithm - Overview & Guide

## 🌲 What is Random Forest?
Random Forest is a powerful **supervised learning algorithm** that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. It works by creating multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

> Think of it as a "forest" of decision trees that collectively vote on the best prediction!

## 🧩 Type of Learning
- **Supervised Learning** ✅
- Not Unsupervised (It requires labeled data for training.)

## 🚀 What Can Random Forest Be Used For?

| Task Type        | Use Case Examples                                 | Supported |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Classification  | Spam detection, disease diagnosis, image labeling | ✅         |
| Regression      | House price prediction, sales forecasting         | ✅         |
| Clustering      | Unsupervised grouping of data                    | ❌         |
| Dimensionality Reduction | Feature selection via importance ranking   | ✅ (indirect) |

## 🛠️ How Does Random Forest Work?

1. **Bootstrapping (Sampling):**
   - Randomly selects samples (with replacement) from the dataset.

2. **Building Decision Trees:**
   - For each sample, a decision tree is grown using a random subset of features.

3. **Aggregation:**
   - For classification: Takes the majority vote.
   - For regression: Takes the average of predictions.

4. **Final Prediction:**
   - Combines the predictions from all trees to make a final decision.

## 🎯 Advantages

- Handles both classification and regression tasks.
- Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees.
- Handles missing values well.
- Provides feature importance estimates.
- Works well with large datasets.


## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- Can be computationally intensive (many trees = longer training time).
- Less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.
- Requires careful tuning for optimal performance.


---

## 🔧 Hyperparameters to Tune

- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest.
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of each tree.
- `min_samples_split`: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
- `max_features`: Maximum number of features considered for splitting.


---

## 💡 When to Use Random Forest?
- When you need high accuracy.
- When your data has both numerical and categorical features.
- When interpretability is less critical than performance.

## 🚀 Example in Python

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Check accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```
