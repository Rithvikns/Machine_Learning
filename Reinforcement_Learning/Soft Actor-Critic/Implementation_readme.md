The Python program in the implementation.

1. Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as gym, torch, numpy, and matplotlib.

stable_baselines3 is used to implement the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.

Google Colab’s files module is used to download the trained model.

2. Setting Up the Environment
The environment Pendulum-v1 is initialized using make_vec_env().

This environment is continuous-action based, making it a good testbed for SAC.

The script also checks if a GPU is available for training to accelerate computation.

3. Initializing the SAC Model
The SAC algorithm is initialized with the "MlpPolicy", meaning it uses a feedforward neural network for function approximation.

The training logs are directed to TensorBoard for monitoring progress.

4. Training the Agent
The agent is trained for 100,000 timesteps using .learn().

During training, the agent interacts with the environment, optimizing its policy to maximize rewards while balancing exploration via entropy.

5. Saving and Downloading the Trained Model
The trained SAC model is saved as sac_pendulum.zip.

In Google Colab, the script automatically downloads the model so it can be reused later.

6. Evaluating the Trained Agent
The model is tested on the environment for 5 episodes to assess its performance.

The script computes the mean and standard deviation of episode rewards to measure consistency.

7. Plotting Training Progress
The script extracts TensorBoard logs and plots the mean episode reward over training steps.

This helps visualize learning progress and convergence.

8. Visualizing the Agent’s Behavior
The trained agent interacts with the environment for a few steps.

It renders the environment to showcase how the agent behaves after training.

This step-by-step structure ensures that SAC is implemented efficiently while being fully c
